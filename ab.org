*Abstinence*

*THE PROMISE*

"Why am I abstaining again?" You ask yourself this because
subconsciously you want to let it all out, the urges mess with your
reasoning. You can let it out after finishing 1 month of abstinence.

* The Reality of the Matter

   Increased T
   More energy
   A sense of confidence
   Androgen receptors get healed, you get better overall health
   Dopamine receptors get healed, you get motivation
   Retain vital nutrients
   Lucidity
   Happiness
   
** Busting
   Start back at square one
   Post nut clarity is a bitch
   Insensitive androgen receptors
   Fried dopamine receptors
   Long term high prolactlin
   Lose vital nutrients

* Setbacks
** Bedtime
*** Can't sleep quickly enough
    Possible solutions;
    1. Decide beforehand when you're going to sleep and turn off the
       AC prematurely, this will make you feel sleepy and increase the
       chances of you sleeping quickly once you lie down
*** Erections
    Possible solutions:
    1. Wear sleeping pants at bedtime

** Not whole
** Depression
** Loneliness
** Putting up with libido
** Benefits pale in light of urges
   
* Concerns  

* Post Nut Clarity
  Ejaculation and Orgasm aren't worth it, by the time I've shot all
  I've got in me I wish I had never relapsed.

* Abstinence Habits
  1. Wear sleeping pants at bedtime
  2. The moment you get an urge while you're not sleeping in bed, get
     off of bed and situate yourself elsewhere
